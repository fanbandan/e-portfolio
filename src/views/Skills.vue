                Problem analysis is important for almost aspects of engineering.
                As part of my long-term career goals, I recognise this is a
                skillset that I need to indepth expertise in.
              </p>
              <p>
                One on the greatest demonstrations of my problem analysis
                development to date has been working in the Toshiba
                International Corporation web based project management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of this project I had to design a new database structure
                that would allow for previous systems data to be migrated. With
                over 10â€™000 rows of data, the task involved lots of careful
                planning to ensure no data was lost. This was of critical
                importance as the system contained all project finances.

                This is an area I do not have much experience in. To progress as
                an engineer I know I need to develop my knowledge of Legal and
                regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am trying to develop my knowledge in this area, in particular
                through my exposure to regulatory requirements at Jenkins
                Engineering Defence Systems.
